6. Important Notes

Python Version: Python 3.7
OpenCV: opencv-python 3.4.2.16

a. kmeans.py
- The data generation code used for testing with n_features=2, has been written assuming the number of cluster centers
  will not change during future testing.
- When changing the n_features for testing with multidimensional data, kindly update the initial center dimensions as well.
- I have taken the standard deviation of each normal distribution to be 0.7. It is not hard-coded, can be changed.

b. displaying_images.py
- The links to the images which have been used for displaying are in points: 3.m, 3.n, 3.o, 3.p
- The images are present in the display folder within the data directory
